# simple-GY88
A simple library 10DOF, GY-88 sensor (MPU6050, HMC5883L and BMP085). Easy to use, out of the box!

It's basically a wrapper for libraries made by Korneliusz JarzÄ™bski (HMC5883L), Jeff Rowberg (MPU6050),
and Jim Lindblom of Sparkfun Electronics (BMP085). Thanks so much to all of you for helping beginners
like me get into microcontrollers and reading these sensors!

Right now, it's just an example, but I'm currently fleshing it out into a beginner-friendly library!
It won't be very complex or allow for very much configuration, so if you feel the need to get deeper
into the nitty-gritty, feel free to visit any of the libraries above!



Each library is licensed under a different license:
HMC5883L- version 3 GNU General Public License
BMP085- CC BY-SA v3.0
MPU6050(I2Cdev)- MIT license

Because of the different licenses used, I have to license this under the most restrictive- GPLv3, I believe.
Still unsure about the whole thing, so feel free to let me know otherwise!
